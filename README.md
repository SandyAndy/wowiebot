# wowiebot

wowiebot is a self-hosted (meaning hosted by you, not by me) that you can download and use. It's easy to use and new features are being added all the time. You can use the wowiebot account, or a different account if you want!

wowiebot was developed using the framework [twitchat](https://github.com/chhopsky/twitchat) by the lovely chhopsky.
